having recently completed both the
00:03
world's most extensive system of
00:05
expressways and the planet's longest
00:07
high-speed rail network China is now
00:09
looking beyond its borders for
00:11
opportunities to keep building President
00:14
Xi Jinping announced at a recent summit
00:16
that Beijing has sealed mega project
00:18
deals with 65 countries throughout
00:21
Eurasia and Africa to construct ports
00:24
power stations rail lines roads and all
00:27
the tunnels and bridges needed to
00:29
connect them back to mainland China at a
00:32
total cost of over 1 trillion dollars
00:34
the one belt one Road initiative is
00:37
unprecedented in size and scope so is
00:40
the bold funding mechanism China will
00:42
use its large state-run banks to provide
00:45
most of the financing a risky move when
00:48
you consider how few of the nations in
00:50
the OBO are could afford something like
00:53
this on their own
00:54
oh say leaders of economically
00:56
challenged underdeveloped Laos Yemen or
00:59
Ethiopia or the blood-soaked regime of
01:02
Bashar al-assad in war-ravaged Syria you
01:04
want to loan us billions of dollars to
01:06
build some cool stuff in our countries
01:08
of course why not China is hard selling
01:12
the project as a way to boost its
01:14
westward connections an update of the
01:16
Silk Road trade route that played a
01:18
significant role in developing China and
01:20
the rest of the region 1,000 years ago
01:22
but many analysts see this comparison as
01:24
little more than a marketing pitch how
01:26
is the real point of this east wind so
01:29
if then simply to boost China's
01:32
westwoods connections well I would say
01:36
simply to boost China's westward
01:39
connections but I totally agree with
01:41
tells that it's a more of a PR stunt to
01:45
call it the Silk Road that that's really
01:47
brilliant evocative of romantic camel
01:50
travels in the past you know when you
01:54
know you have these lovely silks and
01:55
trade and so forth and it's been because
01:58
look at all the headlines it has been
02:00
getting but in practical terms it's
02:05
early days yet aside from the lessons
02:08
China learns from its own recent
02:10
infrastructure boom Beijing is also
02:12
drawing inspirations
02:13
the American Marshall Plan which
02:15
financed the rebuilding of Western
02:16
Europe after was decimated during the
02:18
Second World War that program was worth
02:21
the equivalent of 130 billion in today's
02:23
dollars and ensured the u.s. had
02:25
reliable export markets for the
02:27
manufactured goods and machinery it's
02:30
growing economy had become dependent on
02:32
producing China's modern version first
02:35
announced in 2013 is a signature
02:37
initiative of President Xi Jinping
02:38
several projects have already been
02:40
completed earlier this year London
02:42
became the 15th European city connected
02:44
directly to China to an ever-expanding
02:47
global rail system meaning freight
02:49
trains loaded with goods can now arrive
02:51
after a 12 thousand kilometer journey
02:53
all the way from the east coast of the
02:55
landmass and at a cost of four billion
02:58
dollars China also just completed
02:59
Africa's first transnational electric
03:01
railway which runs 466 miles from
03:04
Djibouti to Addis Ababa the capital of
03:07
Ethiopia Chinese companies designed the
03:09
system built the line and supplied the
03:11
train cars the many other projects under
03:14
the O Bo are umbrella include a six
03:16
billion dollar 260 mile railway
03:19
connecting eight Asian countries
03:20
desperately needed power plants to
03:22
address Pakistan chronic electricity
03:24
shortage part of a larger forty six
03:27
billion dollar investment by China in
03:28
Pakistan aimed at offsetting the
03:30
American and Japanese backed building
03:32
boom happening in neighboring India
03:34
China and Pakistan is mutual rival train
03:37
lines will connect to Budapest and
03:38
Belgrade Serbia providing another artery
03:41
for Chinese goods to reach Europe after
03:43
arriving in the Chinese owned port in
03:44
Greece and in a move that adds prestige
03:47
to OBO our China is financing more than
03:50
a third of the 23 point seven billion
03:52
dollar cost of the Hinkley Point C
03:54
nuclear power plant in southwest England
03:57
part of the challenge in analyzing
04:00
whether this building boom is ultimately
04:02
good for the world is its sheer
04:04
complexity nothing like this has ever
04:06
been done before in human history yes
04:09
providing underdeveloped countries a
04:10
chance to have better transportation
04:12
infrastructure or cleaner power plants
04:14
is a good thing but by funding
04:17
infrastructure that's designed to
04:18
enhance commerce and trade instead of
04:21
basic services many of these countries
04:22
need more like clean drinking water
04:24
affordable housing
04:26
and better education China's motives
04:28
seemed to favor the wealthy elite
04:30
business class
04:31
here are some other major factors that
04:33
explain why China is undertaking a
04:35
project of this magnitude the Communist
04:37
Party has staked its reputation on
04:39
non-stop economic growth since they hold
04:41
all the power the Chinese people expect
04:43
them to deliver but with its domestic
04:45
mega project boom nearing completion
04:47
China must find new buyers for all the
04:50
steel cement and construction machinery
04:52
its economy produces for many of its
04:54
factories could grind to a halt it has
04:56
decided the solution is one belt one
04:58
Road but lending hundreds of billions of
05:01
dollars to many countries with weak
05:02
credit ratings and unstable political
05:05
systems is very risky
05:06
which reveals an underlying sense you
05:09
get when you look closely at one belt
05:11
one road China's increasing desperation
05:13
the country's national debt is already
05:15
very high but borrowing continues to
05:18
accelerate at historic levels as
05:19
state-owned banks loan more and more
05:21
money to state-owned companies the prime
05:23
example of the risks associated with the
05:25
tight rope the Communist Party is trying
05:27
to walk with the government's bailout
05:29
issued during China's recent stock
05:31
market collapse that crisis was caused
05:33
by the same sense of impatience that's
05:35
driving OBO our parties need to feed the
05:38
insatiable economic growth monster using
05:41
its powerful propaganda machine Beijing
05:44
urged its own people to invest their
05:46
savings heavily in its immature unstable
05:49
market causing inexperienced citizens to
05:51
treat investments in companies like bets
05:54
at a casino creating a huge bubble that
05:56
naturally burst the government then
05:59
suspended trading for a while and pumped
06:01
billions into the system to avoid a
06:03
total collapse so really when you step
06:06
back the core motivation for one belt
06:08
one Road boils down to the Communist
06:11
Party's need to buy itself more time in
06:13
order to come up with its next scheme to
06:16
prop up the economy because when it
06:18
inevitably slows down which it's already
06:20
starting to do the party's promised to
06:22
deliver a fantastic economic dreamworld
06:24
will have been proven false from
06:26
everyone in China but the elites the
06:28
silver lining is that many of the
06:31
ventures China has undertaking will pay
06:33
long-term dividends like building up its
06:35
high-tech
06:36
Manufacturing Center with the
06:37
anticipation that when OBO large
06:39
transportation networks are complete it
06:42
will be ready to use them to deliver
06:43
higher cost goods like iPhones drones
06:46
and green energy technologies to the
06:48
rest of the world the other major
06:51
motivating factor here is the
06:53
unmistakable opportunity to gain even
06:56
power status with the United States in
06:58
Asia the election of Donald Trump and
07:00
then his decision to walk away from the
07:02
trans-pacific partnership trade deal
07:03
that would have hurt China are massive
07:06
geopolitical mistakes completely
07:08
unforced errors that China intends to
07:11
take full advantage of when it first
07:13
announced the OBO are back in 2013
07:15
Barack Obama had just begun his second
07:17
term and the u.s. pivot to Asia was in
07:20
full force with rivals like Japan South
07:22
Korea and Vietnam challenging China's
07:25
efforts to control maritime trade routes
07:27
it was clear China was being hemmed in
07:29
on its eastern flank despite the
07:31
election of trump this is still true so
07:34
by instead turning to the vast landmass
07:36
to the west for new opportunities China
07:38
minimizes its reliance on maritime trade
07:40
routes that could be cut off in the
07:42
event of a destabilizing military
07:44
conflict at the end of the day
07:46
China is all about that business it
07:49
doesn't matter if you're a democracy a
07:51
dictatorship or a failed state China
07:54
wants to work with you but this
07:55
willingness to embrace some of the
07:57
world's more unsavory characters could
07:59
backfire just look at who she is sitting
08:02
next to at the OBO our summit Russia's
08:04
Vladimir Putin and Turkey's heir to lon
08:06
two men who look more and more like
08:09
dictators clinging to power with each
08:11
passing day that's not a good look for
08:14
China and it reminds us that the
08:16
Communist Party is even less transparent
08:18
but in a world where the President of
08:20
the United States is a bumbling fool
08:22
these partnerships create much less of
08:25
an image problem now than they would
08:26
have just a few months ago when the
08:28
widely admired Barack Obama was leading
08:30
the free world
08:31
if you ask the Chinese the OBO are is
08:34
all about peace and embrace of the
08:37
concept of coopertition a generation ago
08:40
it was unthinkable for a country to
08:42
invest billions of dollars on
08:44
infrastructure in another country but in
08:46
our hyper globalized world dominated by
08:49
intercom
08:49
tected markets it may become the norm
08:52
especially when we consider the
08:54
intangible benefits greater economic
08:56
interdependence lowers the risk that
08:58
groups of countries will want to fight
09:01
with other groups of countries many of
09:03
whom are bound together by military
09:05
alliances every one of these projects
09:08
increases China's soft power giving
09:11
Beijing more and more leverage in any
09:13
future negotiation or military conflict
09:16
the many foreign seaports will build and
09:18
manage for the next half century will be
09:20
particularly valuable chess pieces it's
09:23
understandable that Chinese policy
09:25
makers are romanticizing one belt one
09:26
road as a crowning achievement for their
09:29
nation further recognition that it has
09:31
gained its former status as a great
09:32
civilization that deserves recognition
09:34
around the world but the reality is that
09:37
it still has a long way to go combined
09:39
the following factors may weaken the
09:41
optimistic sales pitches being made to
09:44
foreign officials a recent Oxford
09:46
business school study argued that half
09:48
of Chinese domestic mega-projects
09:50
actually destroyed not generated
09:52
economic value a few of China's previous
09:55
efforts to build mega projects in
09:56
foreign countries like the a2 motorway
09:59
in Poland failed miserably landowners
10:02
and their representatives in the
10:03
National Assembly's host countries are
10:05
pushing back hard against attempts to
10:07
take away their land and public
10:09
demonstrations against some of the
10:11
projects are beginning to take root and
10:12
spread another dose of reality that
10:15
should sober Beijing is that after
10:17
analyzing China's over-leveraged
10:19
financial position its credit rating was
10:22
just downgraded by a major agency whose
10:24
analysts concluded that its borrowing is
10:27
raising red flags and second ah McGruff
10:29
will continue to slow down of course
10:31
none of these speed bumps is going to
10:33
stop the Communist Party from attempting
10:35
to execute their Great Leap they are
10:37
committed 100% to embracing a
10:40
fundamental history lesson one we were
10:42
all reminded of by Braga's it's
10:44
improbable win and the unlikely
10:46
ascendance of donald trump that fortune
10:49
favors the bold at least in the short
10:52
run thanks for watching get caught up on
